                        Alt+Tab is a game started during the 2018 RIT Game Dev Club Game Jam, and was voted best design by the judges. The objective of the game is 
                        to play as many games on your computer as you can without the teacher catching you - if you're caught three times 
                        before class ends, you lose!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I worked as the team leader, a programmer, and worked on ensuring that 
                        the art assets would be smoothly implemented into the game. The games that you play on your computer
                        within this game are currently Pong, Whack-A-Mole, and an instant messaging minigame. As a programmer, I worked on 
                        creating the Pong minigame, and worked on allowing all of the minigames to be integrated into the main game in the same manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Future development plans of this project include improving the sprites we have, improving our user interface and experience, adding more 
                        minigames, and implementing a smoother way to integrate the minigames.

                        The Amiibo Searcher project was a class project where I worked with one other person to create an interface for
                        a user to easily interact with an API. The API that we chose held information on all of the amiibos that have been
                        released thus far. We both worked together on most of the code for the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user can search for amiibos by choosing the game series that they come from, or by searching for the character's name, or both.

                        This game was a semester-long group project that was built with Monogame. It is a 2D platformer where
                        the player plays as a bird who is trying to get home, and avoid squirrels. The project also included a 
                        level editor to allow both developers and players to create a level easily. For this project, I suggested
                        the initial game concept and created the art assets, and was the primary developer of the level editor tool.

                <h4>Hello, I'm Miranda Auriemma!</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm an interactive developer with a huge passion for designing and programming software that people enjoy. I am currently 
                    studying at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a major in Game Design and Development and a minor in Japanese. 
                    I love designing and programming efficient code to solve complex problems, and I love when others can benefit from my 
                    efforts and truly enjoy what I create. I enjoy working on my own or on a team, where I do whatever I can to help the 
                    team be the best it can be, whether it is creating tools, working directly with the end product, or both.
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing games, participating in game jams, and participating in RIT's Game Symphony Orchestra.
