                    These are two simulations of autonomous agents executing a flocking algorithm. Both utilize the base 
                    steering forces of autonomous agents, seeking and fleeing, to move, flock together, avoid obstacles, and stay within the 
                    boundaries. The 2 dimensional flocking simulation was assigned as a final project for a class, however I had so much fun 
                    with it that I decided to extend it to 3 dimensions, and I am very happy with how it turned out.

                    The base forces of autonomous agents are seeking, which steers the agent towards a location, and fleeing, which steers the 
                    agent away from a location. The flocking simulation, in essence, involves giving the agent a list of things to seek, and a 
                    list of things to flee, and telling them how much or how little they should seek or flee each thing, and in the case of obstacle 
                    avoidance, tell them which direction they should flee in.

                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that came with this project was resolving a flaw in my implementation of the algorithm that 
                    didn't fully present itself until I had a large flock moving in 3 dimensions. The flaw was in the way that I implemented wandering, 
                    the part of the algorithm that moves the individual agents forward. It involves telling the agent to "seek" a random point in front of it. 
                    Each flocker would pick and seek a point independently of the other flockers, which also meant they were all wandering in completely different 
                    directions. When combined with the other parts of the algorithm, it made the flock appear to make a round bulge in the back, and fan out in 
                    the font, with a pinch in the middle. It almost looked like the flock was trying to pull itself apart. I realized that the best way to fix it 
                    would most likely be to refactor my implementation of wandering so that each flocker would be given the same direction to "wander" in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This fix took a good amount of time and a significant amount of refactoring, because most of the implementation of wandering was based on the 
                    fundamental flaw that each of the flockers should be wandering independently of the others. However, the end result is a flock of cats that 
                    moves like a real school of fish.
