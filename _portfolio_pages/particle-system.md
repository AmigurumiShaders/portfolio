## Welcome to another page

This is a simple particle system that allows the user to edit some of its parameters through a user interface.

This particle system is built off of an existing DirectX 11 project, which was originally given as barebones starter code for my graphics programming class. I continue to use this and another version as a sandbox framework to explore and experiment with different parts of graphics programming.

Dear ImGui was used as the UI framework for this project.
