This is a standalone raymarching tool that allows the user to create a scene by combining different shape primitives. This is intended to allow users to explore and create visuals unique to raymarching, without requiring that they understand how to write the required shader math. 

My role in this project focused very much on UI integration (using ImGUI) and overall architecture. Both my partner for this project and myself were relatively new to DirectX 12 when we started, so this project was also a great learning experience and challenge.
