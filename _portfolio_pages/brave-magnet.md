 This game was made as part of a collaboration between Rochester Institute of Technology and Kyoto Computer Gakuin in Japan, for Global Game Jam 2022. Our team was comprised of 3 American RIT students, and 4 Japanese KCG students.

This project was an amazing opportunity for me to put my growing Japanese ability to the test to facilitate communication between the rest of the team. I was able to push past the nerves and fear of mistakes to help keep everyone on the same page and help keep momentum in discussions. I was also able to help the Japanese team members with git operations that they weren't confident with.

My direct development contributions to this project mainly involved VFX particle work with Niagara.
