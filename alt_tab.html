                <h6>Game Jam Group Project</h6>
                <p>
                    Alt+Tab is a game started during the 2018 RIT Game Dev Club Game Jam, and was voted best design by the judges. The objective of the game is 
                    to play as many games on your computer as you can without the teacher catching you - if you're caught three times 
                    before class ends, you lose!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I worked as the team leader, a programmer, and worked on the implementation of sprites into the game. This 
                    involved explaining to the artists what exactly we needed their art assets to be, to make it easiest for the programmers to immediately
                    implement them. As a programmer, I worked on creating a Pong minigame for you to play on your "computer" in the game. I also helped other programmers with problems they
                    were having, and worked on adding the minigame scenes into the main game scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating the minigames into this project was one of the more difficult parts of this project. This was because, despite 
                    knowing that it was possible with Unity to render a scene on an object within another scene, none of us were able to find out how to do so
                    in a reasonable amount of time. With the jam ending soon, we decided to instead work around this by essentially copying the contents of each
                    separate scene into the main game scene. While this worked, it was unstable and buggy. After the jam, we finally found out about Unity's Render Texture
                    material, which would make a texture for something based on a camera's output. I was able to implement this and it worked wonderfully.

                    One of the biggest challenges for me as the team lead was learning how to balance directing and helping members of my team with being an effective programmer,
                    something that I was accustomed to being able to do for much longer uninterrupted chunks of time, even in other group projects. This was one of the first times
                    I had ever lead a team for a project, and definitely my first time leading a team that was under such a short time limit. I quickly learned to expect frequent
                    interruptions, with people asking questions such as what art assets needed to be worked on next, clarifications on game mechanics, suggestions on
                    how to implement them, and merge conflicts in the git repository. I also learned how to quickly pick up on how well people understood what I was explaining to them, and how to more effectively rephrase things 
                    if what I was trying to say was not coming across properly. While I made a lot of mistakes, and I still need a lot more practice in this position, our game was 
                    more successful than any of us expected it to be in the end. This experience gave me the confidence I need to be more willing to take on similar roles
                    in the future. 
                </p>

                    Future development plans of this project include bug fixes, improving the sprites we have, improving our user interface and experience, and adding more 
                    minigames.
