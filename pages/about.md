I'm a game developer with a newfound love for technical art - particularly the graphics, VFX, and tools area of technical art. I love the thrill of throwing myself at challenging projects, especially to explore unfamiliar technologies and ideas. I graduated in 2021 from Rochester Institute of Technology with a degree in Game Design and Development, and I am currently pursuing a graduate degree from the same program. In my free time, I enjoy games, crochet, learning languages, and playing flute in RIT's Game Symphony Orchestra.
