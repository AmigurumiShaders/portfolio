                    This prototype game was made for a class focused on the development of casual games. This is a platformer with one major difference from others - the jumping happens on a specific pattern, and the player has no control over it. Audio and visual cues allow the player to prepare to use the jump to progress or avoid overhead hazards that they would otherwise hit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, as a programmer I primarily worked on trying to tune the jumping to feel more natural and less floaty - which proved to be a much more challening task than any of us thought. Because of this, while I was able to make some decent progress, in the end I wasn't able to have something that could actually be implemented in time for the deadline. Due to the intent being a prototype, we ultimately decided it wasn't as necessary as the other mrchanics and chose to focus on those as a team to get it over the finish line in time.

                    In addition to this, I also proposed a set of git practices for us to follow as a team based on the git practices I learned and followed while on my Co-Ops at Eagledream Technologies. Thanks to these, as a team we were able to mitigate and avoid many of the nightmares we had previously encountered with git, particularly merge conflicts. This helped us grow both our individual and team confidence in our ability to use a tool we previously dreaded.
