                <p>
                    This game was a semester-long group project that was built with Monogame. It's a 2D platformer where
                    the player plays as a bird who is trying to get home, and avoid squirrels. For this project, I suggested
                    the initial game concept and created the art assets, and was the primary developer of the level editor tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The level editor works by looking at how the tiles have been filled in by the user when they user saves the level. Based on this, it fills in 
                    a text file with information about each tile, which the game then parses when it loads a level. This project
                    was difficult because when I started it, I had very little idea of how to go about making the editor portion itself.
                    The solution that I came up with, while it worked, was clunky, slow, and extremely buggy. After discussing this with some classmates, 
                    they suggested alternative methods of implementing a level editor, which were much more reliable and faster. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, while I am still proud of the effort I put in to this project, it was still very rough. By this point in time every time I look back on it I see 
                    improvements that can be made, and I can't help but be excited for my next opportunity build a level editor for a game, just to have another shot at it.
